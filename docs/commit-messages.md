# FLOCX Commit Message Best Practices

Commits to FLOCX projects should follow these best practices:

1. **<a name="separate"></a>A commit messages should have a subject line and
   body separated by a blank line.**

   The first line of your commit message is displayed by itself in various
   circumstances (e.g., `git log --oneline`, variously on GitHub, and so
   forth. The subject should provide a succinct summary of the commit in order
   to make these displays useful.

1. **<a name="subject50"></a>The subject message should be limited to 60
   characters or less.**

   The subject line should be kept short, since it is often displayed on
   screen after a commit id.

1. **<a name="subcaps"></a>The subject line should start with a capital
   letter.**

   Readers generally expect the first word in a sentence to be capitalized.

1. **<a name="subperiod"></a>The subject line should not end with a period.**

   This is a common convention for summary descriptions in many situations.

1. **<a name="mood"></a>The subject line should be written in the imperative
   mood.**

   - Instead of: `This commit adds tests for the api class`

       Use: `Add tests for the api class`

   - Instead of: `New widget feature`

       Use: `Implement new widget feature`

1. **<a name="body72"></a>Lines in the body should be wrapped at 72
   characters.**

   Many terminals default to 80 characters in width. Keeping lines wrapped at
   72 characters leaves room for git to indent messages without overflowing
   the width of the terminal.

1. **<a name="explain"></a>The commit message should explain the purpose of the
   commit.**

   We want the git log to be a useful source of information about the project.
   Your commit message should explain *why* you made the changes and should
   summarize the nature of the changes. For example, this isn't a great commit
   message:

   ```text
   New configuration code
   ```

   This is a better one:

   ```text
   Add standard configuration handling code (TG-1234)
   
   In order to operate properly, our service requires a number of
   configuration values to be provided by the operator. This commit introduces
   a standard mechanism for handling configuration options (oslo_config) and
   defines a number of configuration options.
   ```

1. **<a name="bugref"></a>The commit message should reference the
   bug/issue/task/user story to which it applies.**

   Referencing the related bug/issue/etc in your commit message provides
   information about *why* the changes were made. In many situations, the
   reference can be used to automatically update the referenced issue with
   information about the commit or even apply status changes.

   For [GitHub][] issues, use the format `#nnn`, where `nnn` is the GitHub
   issue number. For more information, see [Closing issues using keywords][].

   For [Taiga][] tasks/user stories, use the format `TG-nnn`, where `nnn` is
   the task or user story number. For more information, see [Attach commits to
   elements via commit message][] and [Changing elements status via commit
   message][].
